## Problem 1
A regression analysis relating test scores (Y) to training hours (X) produced the following fitted equation: y ̂=25-0.5x.

**a.** What is the fitted value of the response variable corresponding to x = 7?

$\hat{y} = 25-0.5(7) = 21.5$

**b.** What is the residual corresponding to the data point with x = 3 and y = 30?  Is the point above or below the line? Why?

$\hat{y} = 25-0.5x = 25-0.5(3) = 23.5$

residual = $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = 30-23.5 = 6.5$

The residual corresponding to the data point is above the line since the calculated residual is a positive value.

**c.** If x increases 3 units, how does y ̂ change?

For each one unit increase of x, y decreases by 0.5; so, for a 3 unit increase of x, y would decrease 1.5 units.

**d.** An additional test score is to be obtained for a new observation at x = 6. Would the test score for the new observation necessarily be 22? Explain.

The test score would not necessarily be 22 as the model is used to estimate values and built on a sample set of observations. If you used the model to estimate a value, it would be 22, however the actual value of the observation may differ slightly.

**e.** The error sums of squares (SSE) for this model were found to be 7. If there were n = 16 observations, provide the best estimate for σ^2.

$\hat{\sigma}^2 = MSE = \frac{SSE}{(n-p)} = \frac{7}{16-1} = \frac{7}{15} = 0.467$
